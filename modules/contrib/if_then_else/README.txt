 INTRODUCTION
------------

Ifthenelse module provides a graphical user interface to set
different rules which can work as a replacement of programmatic hook based
approach to add custom actions on different hooks and events.

The goal of this module is to provide site builders with an easy to
use interface to build rules ( code snippets ) based on different 
events, conditions and actions.

The benefit of doing this to allow site builders to build sites faster 
with custom rules they can build.
